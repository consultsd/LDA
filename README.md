# LDA

This article will describe the process to automate the process of topic extraction from a report with minimal manual intervention using technique known as Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA) in Python.  This is useful to mine unstructured textual data and can be used in situations where there is a need to classify or categorize volumes of text into meaningful and distinct topics (eg. classify customer complaints)

Step-by-step guide
The objective of this exercise is to extract the overarching themes from the Royal Commission Report (~530 pages) and validate how well the themes that we obtain from LDA compare with findings based on an article that synthesized the report into 9 broad themes

1. Download the Royal Commission Report from the link below - 
https://financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/reports.aspx

2. Follow the instructions to perform LDA by visiting the following link on GitHub 
https://github.com/consultsd/LDA/blob/master/LDA.ipynb

 I have chosen only 5 themes to start off with but you are free to experiment

3. Article on Royal Banking Commission Report findings for comparison
